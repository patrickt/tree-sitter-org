*You want https://github.com/milisims/tree-sitter-org.*


This project declares a [[https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/][tree-sitter]] grammar for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Org-mode][Org-mode]] documents.

As with most tree-sitter parsers, it accepts a slight superset of the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html][Org grammar]].

Thanks to [[https://github.com/fosskers/][@fosskers]], to whose Org-mode parser in Haskell I referred often.

Known bugs:
- Barely implemented, much less complete
